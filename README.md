# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis 🎬

This project analyzes over 375,000 trending YouTube videos from 10 countries to uncover what drives virality across content, categories, timing, and engagement behavior.

We performed data cleaning, merging, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand viewership trends, audience interaction, and global popularity patterns.
